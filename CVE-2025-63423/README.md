# CVE-2025-63423 - Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information allows attackers to easily retrieve administrator credentials

## Affected Product
- Vendor/Brand: Each Italy
- Device: Wireless Mini Router WIRELESS-N 300M
- Firmware: v28K.MiniRouter.20190211

## Summary
<img src="images/wireless_n_mini_router.jpg" height="180" width="160" align="right"/>
<p>This device stores the administrator password in plaintext.</p>
<p>The /login.htm and /pass.htm pages in the Web management interface contain the administrator credentials.</p>
<p>The session cookie contains a base64-encoded "username:password" and is stored/transmitted without any protection.</p>
<p>All the traffic is HTTP, so an attacker can easily intercept it.</p>

## Proof of Concept

### Plaintext in source code
The `/login.htm` and `/pass.htm` endpoint expose credentials in plaintext within a script in the HTML source.

`/login.htm`:
```html
var user_lang="0";
var admin_password="password";
var settp = '0'*1;
```

`/pass.htm`:
```html
addCfg('username',0x010b0200,'admin');
addCfg('newpass',0x01010200,'password');

var oldPasswd = "password";
```

### Cookie
After authentication, the session cookie contains:
```
Cookie: Authorization=Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
Decoding the base64 reveals `admin:password`

Observations:
   - An attacker with access to the cookie (via XSS, network sniffing, or physical access) or to the page source can retrieve the credentials without needing to crack any hash.

## Vendor Communication
Attempts to find any security contact or support channel of the original vendor were unsuccessful. The product appears to be a rebranded device of unknown origin.
